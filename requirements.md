# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for a Visual Studio 2022 Extension that integrates Aider AI functionality to provide an AI-powered development experience similar to Cursor AI. The extension will feature a chat interface with contextual file referencing, inline code editing with visual diff display, and AI-powered tab completion using configurable models.

4. WHEN I reference code in chat THEN the system SHALL maintain the file path and line number information

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to see visual diffs of Aider's changes in the editor, so that I can easily understand what code was modified.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Aider makes changes to a file THEN the system SHALL display removed lines in red highlighting
2. WHEN Aider makes changes to a file THEN the system SHALL display added lines in green highlighting
3. WHEN changes are applied THEN the system SHALL show line-by-line diff visualization similar to Cursor AI
4. WHEN I hover over changed lines THEN the system SHALL show tooltips with change details
5. WHEN multiple files are changed THEN the system SHALL provide navigation between modified files

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want AI-powered tab completion while typing, so that I can write code more efficiently with intelligent suggestions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I type code in the editor THEN the system SHALL provide AI-powered completion suggestions
2. WHEN I press Tab THEN the system SHALL accept the current AI suggestion
3. WHEN I configure the AI model THEN the system SHALL support ChatGPT, Claude, and Ollama (local/remote)
4. WHEN using Ollama THEN the system SHALL allow configuration of local and remote endpoints
5. WHEN the AI model is unavailable THEN the system SHALL fall back to standard Visual Studio IntelliSense

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to configure AI model settings, so that I can choose between different AI providers based on my preferences and setup for tab completion.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I access extension settings THEN the system SHALL provide options to select AI model (ChatGPT, Claude, Ollama)
2. WHEN I select ChatGPT THEN the system SHALL require API key configuration
3. WHEN I select Claude THEN the system SHALL require API key configuration
4. WHEN I select Ollama THEN the system SHALL allow configuration of endpoint URL and model name
5. WHEN settings are saved THEN the system SHALL validate the configuration and show connection status

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the extension to integrate seamlessly with Visual Studio's interface, so that it feels like a native part of the IDE.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the extension is loaded THEN it SHALL follow Visual Studio's theming and styling guidelines
2. WHEN Visual Studio theme changes THEN the extension SHALL adapt its appearance accordingly
3. WHEN I use keyboard shortcuts THEN the extension SHALL respect Visual Studio's shortcut conventions
4. WHEN the extension displays notifications THEN it SHALL use Visual Studio's notification system
5. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL log them to Visual Studio's output window

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to quickly fix code errors using Aider AI through the editor's error context menu, so that I can resolve issues efficiently without manually copying error details.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN there are compilation or analysis errors in my code THEN the system SHALL add a "Fix with Aider" option to the error quick fix menu
2. WHEN I click "Fix with Aider" on an underlined error THEN the system SHALL add the error description and problematic code lines to the chat context
3. WHEN the error context is added to chat THEN the system SHALL include the file path, line numbers, and error message
4. WHEN multiple errors exist on the same line THEN the system SHALL include all relevant error information

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to send errors from the output window to Aider chat, so that I can get AI assistance for build and runtime errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN errors appear in the Visual Studio output window THEN the system SHALL display an "Add to Aider Chat" button next to error entries
2. WHEN I click the "Add to Aider Chat" button THEN the system SHALL add the complete error message and context to the chat
